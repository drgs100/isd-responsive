      <h2>About ISD</h2>
    
      <p>Scotland has some of the best health service data in the world. Few other countries have information which combines high quality data, consistency, national coverage and the ability to link data to allow patient based analysis and follow up. The Information Services Division (ISD) is a division of National Services Scotland, part of NHS Scotland. ISD provides health information, health intelligence, statistical services and advice that support the NHS in progressing quality improvement in health and care and facilitates robust planning and decision making.</p>

Our report <a href="/whats-new/Stress-Urinary-Incontinence-and-Pelvic-Organ-Prolapse/">Analysis of NHS information on surgery for stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in Scotland</a> gives a summary of the analysis that was carried out and what was found.<br />
