       <h2>Scottish Breast Screening Programme</h2>



      <p>The UK was one of the first countries in the world to establish a national population-based breast screening programme. There are six static screening centres in Scotland supported by nineteen mobile units. The first screening centres became operational in 1988 and in 2008 the NHS Breast Screening Programme in Scotland celebrated its 20th Anniversary; full national coverage was attained in 1991. </p>

      <p>The UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP), a UK-wide programme of free mammographic screening for breast cancer, was introduced in 1988 following a recommendation from a working party established by the four UK Departments of Health and chaired by Sir Patrick Forrest. The working party concluded that there was evidence that screening for breast cancer could reduce mortality from the disease by up to 30%.</p>

      <p>In Scotland, women aged 50-64 years were invited for a routine screen once every three years until 2003-04, when the age range for invitation was extended to include women up to the age of 70 years. This expansion was phased in throughout the country over a three year round of screening. Women over 70 years are still screened three yearly on request.</p>

      <p>Up until 2007-08, the screening method used in Scotland consisted of two mammographic views at first screen and one view at subsequent screens. In Better Cancer Care, An Action Plan the Scottish Government affirmed its commitment to the implementation of two view screening at every screening appointment by April 2010. In 2008-09 a phased roll out of two views commenced and was completed in March 2010.</p>

      <p>Within Scotland (as part of the Scottish Breast Screening Programme) information and performance data are collected by each of the six screening centres and compiled by ISD on an annual basis. The NHSBSP Performance Standards, which minimum and target standards are specified, are the means by which this information is evaluated. The NHSBSP Performance Standards have been published based on women aged 50-64 to 31 March 2009. To reflect the expansion of the age range, they have been extended to include women up to the age of 70. To allow for trend analysis, NHSBSP Performance Standards based on women aged 50-70 have been produced back to 1 April 2004. Previously published trends in NHSBSP Performance Standards to 31 March 2009, for women ages 50-64, are available in the Tables and Charts section below.</p>

      <h3>Breast screening statistics</h3>



      <h4>Key facts</h4>

      <p>NHSBSP performance standards, at 31 March 2014:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>For the latest three-year period, the uptake rate for Scotland has fallen slightly from 73.5% in 2010-13 to 72.9% in 2011-14. The results for both periods exceed the minimum standard of &gt;70%.</li>

	      <li>The uptake rate for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde was 67.8% in 2011-14. All other NHS Boards achieved the attendance standard of &gt;70% of women invited to a screening appointment.</li>

	      <li>Comparing three-year combined performance figures for those women aged 53-70 years with a previous screen within 5 years of attendance, the invasive cancer detection rate has increased from 5.7 per 1,000 women screened in the period 2005-08 to 6.8 in 2011-14. </li>

	      <li>In 2013/14, all but 1 of the 13 NHS Breast Screening Programme minimum performance standards were achieved and all but 2 of the 11 targets were met.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>In 2013-14:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Over 1,450 cases of screen detected breast cancer were diagnosed in women of all ages. </li>

	      <li>Of these over 80% (1,255 cases) of cancers detected were invasive, of which over half were less than 15mm in size and unlikely to be detected by a physical examination.</li>

      </ul>
