      <h2>Genetics Genealogy</h2>
      <p>The Genetics Genealogy Team provides a unique service researching Statutory Birth, Marriage and Death certificates through the National Records of Scotland to build a family history. We use this family tree, along with cancer registry information, to validate a family history of a patient who has been referred to clinical geneticists with a possible risk of an inherited genetic condition. By supplying accurate, informative and comprehensive information geneticists can use this information to complete a risk assessment for the patient. Risk assessment may result in gene testing, prophylactic surgery, screening appropriate to the determined risk or reassurance and discharge from the care of clinical genetics services. For the NHS, determining more accurate genetic risk and managing it appropriately, means limited and expensive resources are used in the most effective manner.</p>

      <p>An overview of our cancer work is contained in this report: <a href="_docs/Cancer-Genetics-The-Key-to-the-Future-Lies-in-the-Past.pdf">ISD Cancer Genetics Genealogy Service: The Key to the Future Lies in the Past<img src="http://www.isdscotland.org/images/download_pdf_button.gif" alt="Download PDF file"/></a> [44Kb].</p>

			

			<p><strong>Information Requests (Genetic Clinics only) </strong></p>

			

			<p>When cancer information is required for specific relatives then an information request should be sent in via our dedicated genetics database, post or email (please note that you must have a  nhs.net or nhs.uk email address).  The following information is advantageous for the search and the more information supplied the higher chance a match will be found. If the individual is still alive, written consent is mandatory. We do not have access to out of Scotland registry information or Statutory records so we can only research individual's who have had treatment or died in Scotland.</p>

			

			<ul>

			<li>Forename(s)</li>

				<li>Surname(s)</li>

<li> Maiden Name (if applicable) </li>

				<li>Date of birth</li>

				<li>Date of death (if applicable)</li>

				<li>Address</li>

				<li>Diagnosis</li>

			<li>Date of diagnosis </li>

		</ul>

	

		<p><strong>Pedigree  Research (Scottish clinics only)</strong></p>

	

		<p>The most  unique part of the Genetic Service offered is the genealogical research of  family pedigrees using the Scottish Statutory Records which began in 1855 and  the subsequent matching of deaths post 1958 to Scottish Cancer Registration  data. This provides an extremely informative picture of inherited disease over  several generations often beyond the knowledge of the family informant. These  researched families allow Geneticists to make more confident decisions on  potential family risk. We can only  research Scottish family records and this service is for Scottish clinics only.</p>
