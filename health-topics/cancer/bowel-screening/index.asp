      <h2>Bowel Cancer in Scotland</h2>

      <p>Bowel cancer (or colorectal cancer) is a major public health  problem in Scotland, which has a higher rate of bowel cancer than most other  countries in the Western world. In Scotland it is the third most commonly  diagnosed cancer in both men and women with approximately 4,000 new cases  diagnosed each year. Ninety-five percent of cases occur in people aged over 50  years. Over the last 10 years, bowel cancer incidence (2002-2012) in Scotland  has increased in both men and women, while bowel cancer mortality (2003-2013)  in Scotland has fallen in both sexes. Bowel cancer is the second most common  cause of cancer death for both men and women with around 1,600 people dying of  the disease in Scotland each year. The five year relative survival rate is  approximately 55% for both sexes.</p>
      <p>Bowel cancer screening can identify  pre-cancerous signs in men and women who otherwise have no symptoms, and thus  abnormalities can be investigated and treated. Treatment at this stage is  usually very effective.</p>

      <h3>Scottish Bowel Screening Programme</h3>
      <p>The Scottish Bowel Screening Programme  commenced a phased roll out in June 2007 and by December 2009 all NHS Boards in  Scotland were participating in the Programme. All men and women registered with  a Community Health Index (CHI) number and aged 50-74 years are invited to  participate and be screened every two years.</p>
      <p>Eligible men and women are posted a  guaiac-based faecal occult blood test kit (FOBT) which should be completed at  home. This involves collecting 2 samples from each of 3 separate bowel  movements. The kit is returned in a pre paid envelope to the central screening  centre in Dundee and tested for hidden traces of blood in the stool.  Individuals who have a positive FOBT result are referred to their local  hospital for assessment and, where appropriate, offered a colonoscopy as the  first line of investigation.</p>
      <p>Detailed information about the Scottish  Bowel Screening Programme can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bowelscreening.scot.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">Bowel Screening Manual</a>.</p>      

      <p class="lead">Up to 31 October 2014 in the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Over 2 million people invited</li>
        <li>Almost 1.3 million took up the offer and achieved a final result</li>
        <li>Over 3,800 cancers diagnosed through screening</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scottish Bowel Screening Programme Key  Performance Indicators</h3>
      <p>These indicators were developed to  monitor and evaluate the impact of screening programme. It must be noted that  NHS Boards have been participating in the programme for different lengths of  time, so some are in their prevalence round whilst others are in their  incidence rounds. The KPIs are reported for a two year (screening) period and  the latest report of the Key Performance Indicators for the Scottish Bowel  Screening Programme can be viewed&nbsp;by following this link: <a href="https://isdscotland.scot.nhs.uk/Health-Topics/Cancer/Publications/2015-08-04/2015-08-04-Bowel-Screening-KPI-Full-Report.xlsx">KPI Report published August 2015&nbsp;</a>. <img src="http://www.isdscotland.org/images/download_excel_button.gif" alt="Download Excel file" /></p>

      <h3>Scottish Bowel Screening Pilot</h3>
      <p>The Scottish Bowel Screening Pilot  commenced in April 2000 in Tayside, Grampian and Fife NHS Boards. All men and  women registered with a GP Practice aged 50-69 years were invited to  participate and to be screened every two years. The pilot programme finished in  May 2007.</p>
      <p>The pilot was split into three rounds,  with each round encompassing a two yearly screening cycle. The screening  algorithm (procedure) evolved over the three rounds. <a href="http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/bowel/finalreport.pdf" target="_blank">The initial algorithm is detailed in the full evaluation report</a> <img src="http://www.isdscotland.org/images/download_pdf_button.gif" alt="Download PDF file"/>. In the second round, dietary restriction for the repeat test was not  required. In the third round, repeat testing of those who had a negative test  following a weak positive initial test was not undertaken. Over 300,000  individuals were invited to each of the rounds of the Bowel Screening Pilot,  with around 410,000 invited to all three rounds.</p>
      <p>The Key Performance Indicators for all  rounds of the pilot are available to view in <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Cancer/Bowel-Screening/SBSPilotKeyPerformanceIndicators.pdf" target="_blank">SBoSPKeyPerformanceIndicators</a>. <img src="http://www.isdscotland.org/images/download_pdf_button.gif" alt="Download PDF file"/></p>
