      <h2>Use of Cancer Data</h2>
      
      <p>Scottish Cancer Registration makes a  significant contribution to the improvement of cancer services. </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Monitor  trends in cancer incidence, prevalence and survival with time and among  different areas and social groups.</li>
        <li>Evaluate  the effectiveness of cancer prevention and screening programmes. </li>
        <li>Evaluate  the quality and outcomes of cancer care, through the provision of comparative  data about treatment patterns and outcomes.</li>
        <li>Evaluate  the effect of environmental and social factors on cancer risk and support other  investigations into the causes of cancer. </li>
        <li>Investigate  differences in cancer incidence, survival and access to treatment among social  groups and thus contribute to programmes aimed at reducing inequalities in  health outcomes. </li>
        <li>Support the work of cancer genetic counselling services for individuals and families who may be at a higher risk of developing cancer.</li>
        <li>Contribute  to national and international policies and publications, such as the &lsquo;Detect  Cancer Early&rsquo; (DCE) Programme, UK National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN)  publications, Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, EUROCARE (survival from  cancer across Europe), and work for cancer charities. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>More  detail on the role cancer registries have in improving services is described on  the website of the <a href="http://www.ukacr.org/">UK Association of Cancer Registries</a>.</p>
      
      <h3>Cancer Information Requests</h3>
      
      <p>Each  year, we receive approximately 200 cancer information requests from NHS  boards, health organisations, government, other cancer registries, cancer  charities, clinicians, researchers and pharmaceutical companies. The type of  information requested includes data on particular tumour types, treatment  trends, survival, mortality data, diagnostic information, stage distribution  etc.</p>
