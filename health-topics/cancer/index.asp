      <h2>Cancer Information Introduction</h2>

      <p>The Scottish Cancer Registration scheme has been managed by ISD since 1997 and has been collecting information on cancer since 1958. The data are used for a wide variety of purposes which include: public health surveillance; health needs assessment, planning and commissioning cancer services; evaluation of the impact of interventions on incidence and survival; clinical audit and health services research; epidemiological studies; and providing information to support genetic counselling and health promotion.</p>
      <p>The cancer statistics pages provide a wide range of statistical analyses based on data from the Scottish Cancer Registry and the National Records of Scotland. More information about the history and data collected by the Scottish Cancer Registry can be found here. In addition to National Statistics outputs, other less regular reports are produced periodically and are available on this website under Publications/Cancer Statistics.</p>
      <p>There are three cancer screening programmes in Scotland (bowel, breast and cervical) and analytical support for the evaluation and monitoring of these programmes is provided by ISD Scotland. ISD also provides a support service for Clinical trials for cancer and facilitates National Cancer Audits.</p>
