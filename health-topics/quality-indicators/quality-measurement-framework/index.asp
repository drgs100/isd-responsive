      <h2>Quality Measurement Framework</h2>
      
      <p>ISD are committed, through the Quality Strategy, to  simplify and streamline the range of measurement which exists across NHS  Scotland (NHSS) to ensure that maximum value is achieved out of the investment  in data collection and measurement.</p>
      <p>ISD are helping to develop the Quality Measurement  Framework to support the definition of healthcare quality described by the 3  healthcare quality ambitions (Person-centred, Safe and Effective). These  ambitions will be tracked by a small number of high-level measures - called the  Quality Outcome Indicators - combining patient and staff reported experiences  and outcomes as well as clinical outcomes and measures of patient safety.</p>
      <p>See the <a href="../../Quality-Measurement-Framework/index.asp">Quality Measurement Framework</a> section for more details including the latest results for each of the  level 1 Quality Outcome Indicators.</p>
