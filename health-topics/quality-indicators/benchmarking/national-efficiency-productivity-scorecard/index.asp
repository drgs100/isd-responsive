      <p>The National Benchmarking Project (NBP) National Efficiency &amp;  Productivity Scorecard provides a high level overview of healthcare and health  in Scotland  from NHS Board level to hospital/specialty. The main aim of the National  Efficiency &amp; Productivity Scorecard (NEPS) and the associated tools is to  enable and encourage benchmarking against peers and the national level (Scotland and/or England) with a particular emphasis  on identifying efficiency and productivity opportunities.</p>
			<p>There are two versions of NEPS available, an annual publication utilising  both Scottish and English data and a Quarterly release (Q NEPS) which is  published more frequently utilising Scottish data only.</p>
			<p>NEPS comprises of 29 indicators,  ranging from length of stay to sickness absence rates and is updated on an  annual basis when corresponding English data becomes available, allowing  comparison between the two countries.</p>
			<p>Q NEPS comprises of 25 Indicators from NEPS that are able to be updated on a  quarterly basis. These updates will contain a quarters worth of data from about  6 months prior to the update. </p>
			<p>The following features are available within the dashboards:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Scorecard:</dt>
        <dd>Displays results in tabular form for each health board and indicator - depending on the indicator data is available at either Health Board,  board/specialty and hospital/specialty level.</dd>
      </dl>
			<dl>
        <dt>Comparisons:</dt>
        <dd>Illustrates for specific indicators how each Health board performs compared to  the other health boards. The Combined (or Scottish only where applicable) mean  and upper quartile are also displayed. Data is shown at Health Board or  board/specialty level only.</dd>
      </dl>
			<dl>
        <dt>Trend:</dt>
        <dd>Incorporates data for a range of indicators over a five year period. It shows  the board specific rate along with the comparative Combined (or Scottish only  where applicable) mean and upper quartiles. Data is shown at Health Board or  board/specialty level only.</dd>
      </dl>
			<dl>
        <dt>Impact Analysis (NEPS  annual only):</dt>
        <dd>Takes data  from 15 key indicators and illustrates how each Board performs in comparison to  the Combined (or Scottish only where applicable) mean and upper quartile. It  also identifies the improvement required (if any) to reach the combined mean  and upper quartile for each indicator. Data is shown at Health Board or Board/specialty  level only.</dd>
      </dl>
			<dl>
        <dt>Board Review (NEPS  annual only):</dt>
        <dd>A Summary report (Baseline Assessment) for each  Health board combining information from each of the tools above on a number of  key indicators is also available.</dd>
      </dl>
