			<h3>Archived Data</h3>
			<p>In 2010 the Scorecard underwent a review with the Scottish Government and  the number of indicators was reduced from 76 to 31 in order to focus on the key  efficiency and productivity opportunities. Previous Whole System Scorecard  publications are available on the <a href="http://www.elib.scot.nhs.uk/SharedSpace/communities/Pages/login.aspx?ContainerID=194578">Knowledge Network</a> under the Benchmarking  Project community page.</p>
