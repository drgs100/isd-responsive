      <h2>National Benchmarking Project</h2>
      
      <p>The purpose of the National Benchmarking Project is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>to help the Service achieve greater productivity and efficiency; </li>
			  <li>and to support the implementation of change and improvement. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do this by:</p>
        
      <ul>
        <li>providing information which compares a range of measures on service activities;</li>
			  <li>and developing flexible tools to support the investigation and impact of re-design to achieve service efficiency and improvement.</li>
      </ul>
        
 	    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
        
      <p>We take a Balanced Scorecard approach. The balanced scorecard is a strategic management system that requires managers to focus on the important performance metrics that drive success. It balances different perspectives: patient, internal process, financial, and learning and growth. As well as monitoring current performance, it tries to capture information about how well an organisation is positioned to perform in the future.</p>
         
      <p>We combine a whole system high-level strategic overview with specific service-focused projects aimed at identifying operational opportunities for efficiency and improvement. Taking a whole system view is fundamental to our approach. A whole system framework recognises that the NHS in Scotland is a complex system with many interactions and linkages both within and outwith the Service. Service-specific projects cannot be approached in isolation.</p>  
          
      <p><strong>Current Projects</strong></p>  
          
      <p>The following National Benchmarking projects are in development:</p>
