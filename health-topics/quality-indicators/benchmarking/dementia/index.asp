      <h2>Dementia Benchmarking</h2>
      
      <p>To support the commitments outlined in the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0042/00423472.pdf">Scottish Government's Dementia Strategy</a>, the Dementia Benchmarking toolkit provides a mechanism for monitoring and tracking change and improvement over time in respect of dementia services in Scotland. It builds on the themes outlined in the first <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2010/09/10151751/0">Dementia Strategy</a>, providing information to support the five key challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fear of dementia that means people delay in coming forward for diagnosis</li>
      <li>Information and support after diagnosis for those with dementia and their carers is poor or non-existent</li>
      <li>General healthcare services do not always understand how to respond well to people with dementia and their carers, leading to poor outcomes</li>
      <li>People with dementia and their carers are not always treated with dignity and respect</li>
      <li>Family members and people who support and care for people with dementia do not always receive the help they need to protect their own welfare and to enable them to go on caring safely and effectively</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Information supporting and monitoring these challenges is balanced with information on resources and financial measures.</p>
    <p>Background information on the definitions, sources and revisions of the indicators can be found in the following document:</p>
