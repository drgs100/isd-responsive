      <h2>Adult Mental Health Benchmarking</h2>
        
      <p>The principle objective of the Mental Health  Benchmarking project is to improve Mental Health Services by using benchmarking  to understand and compare services and their outcomes and to promote best  practice through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>assessment of the availability and use of Mental Health Information </li>
        <li>developing a common set of Mental Health Service definitions </li>
        <li>developing a balanced scorecard approach to performance </li>
        <li>evaluation of current mental health information system implementations</li>
        <li>evaluation of the role of information in joint mental health planning </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our approach is to use a range of comparative  information to compare key aspects of performance by developing a suite of  appropriate indicators, linked to the Quality Strategy themes of Efficient,  Effective, Person-centred, Safe, Equitable and Timely. The aims of this are to  inform key areas such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>patient experience and health outcomes </li>
        <li>how resources are used and managed </li>
        <li>whether service functions are appropriate, sufficiently sized and appropriately positioned to meet the needs of local communities in the medium and longer term </li>
        <li>achieving best value from current investment when resources are limited </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mental Health Benchmarking Toolkit</h2>
      <p><a role="button" class="btn btn-success btn-lg">Click here to view Mental Health Benchmarking Toolkit 2013/2014</a></p>
      <p>The Mental Health Benchmarking Toolkit helps to facilitate  improvement of the Mental Health services in Scotland by using a range of  comparative information to compare key aspects of performance, identify gaps,  identify opportunities for improvement and monitor progress.</p>
      <p>The information is primarily adult focussed based  on the General Psychiatry and Psychiatry of Old Age specialties, and excludes  Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Learning Disabilities and Forensic Psychiatry  services. However, for certain indicators data are not available at an adult  only level and may pertain to the wider Mental Health service.</p>
      <p>The latest release of the toolkit contains information  up to the end of March 2014. It comprises all available data for the relevant  indicators split across the Quality Strategy domains; and is intended for both  clinical and management use. Background information on the definitions, sources  and revisions of the indicators can be found in the following document:</p>
