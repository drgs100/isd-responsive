      <h2>Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) Benchmarking</h2>

      <p>The main objective of the CAMHS Benchmarking Balanced Scorecard is to  support efforts aimed at closing the gap between stakeholder aspirations and  the outputs of specialist CAMH providers across Scotland. It will act as a  lever, as a barometer of success and as a mechanism for ensuring enhanced  quality, accountability and transparency. It is also a key component of the  Scottish Government's commitment to Child and Adult Mental Health as outlined  in the <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/08/9714">Mental Health Strategy for Scotland: 2012-2015</a></p>
      <p>The balanced scorecard is structured to provide a  balanced view of the service incorporating the aims of the Quality Strategy  domains within the following performance themes: Client/Patient Focus, Delivering  Best Practice, Internal Processes and Best Use of Resources. It achieves this  by taking a range of information on waiting times for young people receiving  mental health services, the workforce employed to provide those services,  hospital activity and several other contextual measures. Further information on  the background to the Balanced Scorecard and all the proposed indicators is  available in the original consultation document</p>

      <p>These data are then collated and presented in the CAMHS Benchmarking toolkit and dashboard which will be published quarterly from September 2013.</p>

      <h3>CAMHS Tier 4 and Benchmarking  Quality Assurance</h3>
      <p>CAMHS Tier 4 is defined as young people with severe complex mental health disorders AND one or more of the following:</p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li>Too high risk to attempt to treat with usual outpatient resources e.g. suicidal, psychotic with disorganisation, self harm or violent behaviour.</li>
        <li>Need for intensive assessment or treatment e.g. equivalent or more weekly outpatient contact with more than one CAMHS professional.</li>
        <li>Not responding to usual outpatient treatment, which may be because they need reassessment or more intensive input.</li>
      </ul>   
      <p>Additional  information for management information and quality assurance purposes is available to NHS Boards and  Scottish Government colleagues at the  link below:</p>
