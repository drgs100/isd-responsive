      <h2>National Theatres Implementation Group (NTIG) Datamart</h2>
      
      <p>The NTIG datamart was launched in November 2011 containing data on theatre activity from January 2007 to the present day. There are two levels of information contained within the datamart: case level data submitted from Theatre management systems and aggregate monthly data. Data from each source are merged to produce standard reports on the eleven key indicators. Users are also able to produce more detailed adhoc analysis by querying the datamart using Business Objects XI.      </p>
      <p>The  data mart is updated: Daily</p>
      <p>The NTIG data mart is part of the NHS National Services Scotland (NSS) Corporate Data Warehouse. The Data Warehouse contains multiple data marts, each of which represents a functional area e.g. acute, prescribing, etc.</p>

      <h2>User Access System</h2>
      <p>Applications for access to the NTIG data mart are now dealt with via the User Access System (UAS).  This system will also automate the 6-monthly or annual renewal/review process administered by an automated e-mail to users and authorisers.</p>
      <p>If access is not regularly reviewed and renewed, access will be removed on the relevant expiry date which is clearly shown for each data mart within the UAS.</p>
      <p>The <strong>User Access System</strong> can be found here:</p>
      <p><a href="https://useraccess.nhsnss.scot.nhs.uk/">https://useraccess.nhsnss.scot.nhs.uk/</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The system uses the same Username and Password needed to access Business Objects and the NSS data marts and information tools.</li>
        <li>New users can obtain access to UAS via the 'register' button on the log in screen. Users will receive the Username and Password details within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>The UAS will allow users to request access to data marts, request changes of access and remove access when no longer required.</li>
        <li>All requests are automatically routed to the relevant authorisers who will be notified of such requests by automated e-mail from UAS.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Access to Data</h3>
      <p>When access is authorised, users will be able to gain access to the relevant data mart using the same username and password used by UAS at the link below.</p>
