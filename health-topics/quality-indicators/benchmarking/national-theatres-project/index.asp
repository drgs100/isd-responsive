      <h2>National Theatres Project</h2>
		
		  <p>The National Theatres Project  Final Report was published in November 2006 (see reports below). The main  objective of the project was to appropriately treat more patients by using  resources more productively and efficiently, with the aim of increasing  efficiency in theatres. To achieve this goal, the main recommendations in the  report were that NHS Boards were to produce a balanced scorecard and to adopt  the detailed data definitions to provide a comparison of theatre performance across  Boards in NHS Scotland.</p>
		  <p>NTIG - National Theatres  Implementation Group</p>
		  <p>Following on from the published  National Theatres project report, NTIG was formed to implement the  recommendations of the report. Data is currently collected by ISD on eleven  separate indicators that cover both quality and efficiency dimensions. For  example, comparative reports are available on theatre utilisation, hours lost  to under runs and late starts. This data is now accessible via the NTIG  datamart allowing Boards to access their own information and at a higher level  compare themselves with other Boards.</p>

		  <h3>NTIG  Dashboard</h3>
		  <p>An interactive dashboard has been  developed to support the information available in the datamart. Access to the  dashboard is password protected and is only accessible to NHSScotland staff and  authorised Scottish Government employees.</p>
