      <p>The NHSScotland Efficiency and Productivity Programme has commissioned the National Benchmarking Project, in partnership with the Quality and Efficiency Support Team, to develop a new suite of indicators to support NHS Boards to identify productive opportunities based on variation in clinical productivity. They are known as the Better Quality Better Value Indicators and consist of:</p>
        
      <ol>
        <li>Average length of stay (ALOS) for high volume specialties </li>
        <li>Pre-operative bed days for surgical specialties </li>
        <li>Outpatient Did Not Attend (DNA) rates for high volume specialties </li>
        <li>Outpatient return to new ratios for high volume specialties </li>
        <li>Daycase rates for surgical specialties </li>
        <li>Low  cost statins</li>
      </ol>
        
      <p>The purpose is to highlight variation in current performance between NHS Boards and Hospital sites and identify the potential productive opportunities. The potential productivity opportunities are estimated by calculating the savings that could be achieved, if NHS Boards/hospital sites (not currently performing at the mean and upper quartile level) moved to perform at the mean and upper quartile for Scotland, England and Combined (England and Scotland). The productivity opportunities are measured in occupied bed days for ALOS and pre-opstay, extra new outpatient appointments for return to new ratio and to reduce DNAs by saving new outpatient appointments. The cash releasing potential is calculated by applying information supplied in the latest Costs Book.</p>
        
      <p>For each indicator the Quality and Efficiency Support Team has also identified the key characteristics of high performing healthcare organisations and the key changes which should be implemented to secure improvements in performance, and have signposted examples of good practice case studies and links to a range of improvement methodologies and toolkits.        </p>
      
      <p>The Better Quality Better Value Indicators are  accessible only to those with NHS net access or appropriate Scottish Government  employees.</p>
            <p>If you would like  access to the Better Quality Better Value Indicators or require further  information, please contact <a href="mailto:NSS.benchmarkingproject@nhs.net">NSS.benchmarkingproject@nhs.net</a>.</p>
