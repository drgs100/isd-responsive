      <h2>Quality Hub</h2>

      <p>The NHS Scotland (NHSS) Quality Strategy builds on  existing policy and strategy documents such as Better Health Better Care and  Leading Better Care and was endorsed by the Scottish Parliament in May 2010.  The Quality Strategy challenges NHS Boards to coordinate and pool resources in  order to meet its aspiration of improving the quality of healthcare in  Scotland. In response to this, &quot;The Hub&quot; is being delivered by a  national collaboration between Healthcare Improvement Scotland, NHS Education  for Scotland (NES), NHS National Services Scotland's Information Services  Division (ISD), the Scottish Government Quality and Efficiency Support Team  (QuEST) and NHS Health Scotland.</p>
      <p>The collaboration manage their contribution through  four key work-streams:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation support that is flexible and responsive;</li>
        <li>Education and learning opportunities that are accessible and relevant;</li>
        <li>Measurement for quality improvement that is meaningful; and</li>
        <li>Facilitation of quality improvement networks for NHS staff.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Development of the Hub is seen as a three-year  programme of work, with Healthcare Improvement Scotland acting as the lead  organisation.</p>
      <p>For more information see the <a href="http://www.qihub.scot.nhs.uk/default.aspx">Quality Improvement Hub</a> website.</p>
      
      <h3>Quality Measurement Framework</h3>
      <p>ISD are committed, through the Quality Strategy, to simplify and streamline the range of measurement which exists across NHS Scotland to ensure that maximum value is achieved out of the investment in data collection and measurement. ISD are currently helping to develop the Quality Measurement Framework to support the definition of healthcare quality described by the 3 healthcare quality ambitions (Person-centred, Safe and Effective). These ambitions will be tracked by a small number of high-level measures combining patient and staff reported experiences and outcomes as well as clinical outcomes and measures of patient safety.</p>
