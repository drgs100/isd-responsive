      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>Each year, the Scottish Government agrees a  suite of national NHS performance targets known as HEAT targets. In return the  NHS Boards state how they will commit to meet their targets as outlined in  their annual Local Delivery Plans. NHSScotland performance against the HEAT  targets and standards contributes towards the delivery of the Scottish  Government's Purpose and National Outcomes; and NHS Scotland's Quality  Ambitions.</p>

      <p>The HEAT system is a web-based information  tool supported and maintained by ISD Scotland on behalf of the Scottish  Government. The system allows NHS Boards  and the Scottish Government to monitor Boards' performance against national  HEAT targets and progress is published on the Scottish Government's &lsquo;Scotland  Performs&rsquo; website. Data for many of the performance measures used to monitor  targets are sourced directly from ISD and, where this is the case, ISD aims to  publish timely and useful data on these performance indicators on our website.</p>

      <h2>Key and Standards measures</h2>
      <p>There  are two main elements to HEAT performance measurement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Key measures relate to targets currently in  operation and performance against a target is monitored by one or more key  performance measures.</li>
        <li>Standard measures are measures for targets  that have passed their target date but are maintained to monitor their progress  or used for other purposes such as  benchmarking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The  Key and Standard Measures for 2014-15, grouped by their relevant HEAT category  are:</p>
