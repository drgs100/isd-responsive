      <h2>Methodology</h2>
		
			<p>The Scottish HSMR utilises  the routine linkage of data obtained from hospital discharge summaries to death  registrations from the National Records of Scotland. The HSMR is calculated for  all acute inpatient and day-case patients admitted to all specialties (medical  and surgical, excluding obstetrics and psychiatry). The calculation takes  account of patients who died within 30 days from hospital admission. This means  that the HSMR includes deaths that occurred in the community (out of hospital  deaths) as well as those occurring in-hospital. Unlike similar indicators adopted  in other parts of the UK, the Scottish HSMR is not a measure of all in-hospital  mortality because it does not include patients that die in-hospital after  30-days from admission.</p>
	
			<p> The Scottish HSMR is  calculated by obtaining routinely collected death certificate data. These crude  mortality data are adjusted to take account of some of the factors known to  affect the underlying risk of death. Development of the case-mix adjustment  methodology for Scotland began in early 2008. Although the method used in England  at that time by Dr Foster informed the Scottish process, the models are  different and reflect differences in the source data. Scottish HSMRs are  therefore not directly comparable to those produced for English hospitals.</p>
			<p>A <a href="../_docs/hsmr_technical_document_v2.pdf">technical document</a> is  available on how the HSMR is calculated and describes the methodology used in  more detail.</p>
