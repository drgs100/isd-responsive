      <h2>Quarterly Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratios (HSMR)</h2>

      <p>Information Services Division (ISD) has produced quarterly hospital standardised mortality ratios (HSMR) for all Scottish hospitals participating in the Scottish Patient Safety Programme (SPSP) since December 2009. The aim of the SPSP was to reduce hospital mortality by 15% by December 2012. This has been extended to a 20% reduction by December 2015.</p>

      <p> The HSMR dashboard provides users with the latest extension to the time series for the SPSP with observations at Scotland, hospital level and Health Board level from October to December 2006 through to April to June 2015. This is available in addition to the routine publication report.</p>	

	    <p>A <a href="_docs/User_Guide_Public_20150515_v0.5.pdf">User Guide</a> is available and we recommend reading this prior to accessing the dashboard for the first time. In addition a video user guide is available at the link below.</p>
      
	    <p>The publication report provides additional information and commentary on patterns of mortality over the longer term and by key demographic factors. There is information on the development of the measure, how it has been embedded in Scotland and how it compares to similar information used in other parts of the UK.</p>
