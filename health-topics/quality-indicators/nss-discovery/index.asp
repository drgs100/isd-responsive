      <h2>NSS Discovery</h2>  
    
      <p>NSS Discovery is an information system that provides approved users with access to a range of comparative information to support performance and quality improvement. Indicators within NSS Discovery can be viewed by NHS Board of treatment or residence. The information within NSS Discovery can help NHS Boards to review performance, benchmark against peers and identify areas where resources can be targeted to address local health and care needs.</p>
      <p>The system is available to authorised users from 22 April 2015. The current release of NSS Discovery is a beta version.  Information from NSS Discovery should therefore be used with caution for day-to-day reporting until we release NSS Discovery Version 1.0, expected to be by September 2015.    </p>
      <p>NSS Discovery is a collaboration between NHSScotland, the Scottish Government and NHS National Services Scotland (NHS NSS).</p>
