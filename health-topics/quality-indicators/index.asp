        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>The aim of the Quality Indicators service area in ISD is to improve healthcare of the population of Scotland by operating as the centre of expertise and to be valued as a leader in the development of quality improvement, efficiency & effectiveness indicators, hospital & benchmarking measures for NHS Services and to provide information in support of decision making for service improvement.</p>

        <p>The <a href="#">Quality Strategy</a> determines the strategic direction of Quality Indicators in ISD and this is reflected in the Local Delivery Plan for National Services Scotland. The strategy recognised the importance of measuring quality to drive large-scale improvement and set out a <a href="#">Quality Measurement Framework (QMF)</a>. There are three levels described by the QMF which encompass a range of indicators and measures, most of which are included in the Quality Indicators service area:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Level 1 contains the national Quality Outcome Indicators,</li>
        <li>Level 2 consists of the <a href="#">HEAT targets</a>, and</li>
        <li>Level 3 covers other indicators and measures.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Quality Indicators service area holds and maintains a growing range of projects across Scotland. Please click on the links on the left-hand margin to find out more.</p>
