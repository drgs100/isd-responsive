      <h2>Current  Complaints Procedure</h2>
      <p>There is wide variation in the type of contacts that patients have with the NHS (e.g. treatment as an inpatient, outpatient, attendance at A&amp;E, blood donation and transportation by ambulance) and patients (or their representatives) can make a complaint if they feel dissatisfied with any aspect of these interactions.</p>
      <p>The NHS Complaints procedure first introduced in April 1996; was subsequently revised in April 2005 and again in April 2012. The revision in 2012 reflects the provisions within <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/Policy/Patients-Rights">The Patient Rights (Scotland) Act 2011</a>, which gives patients the right to give feedback, make comments, raise concerns or make complaints about the health care received from the NHS in Scotland. The act also made provision for the introduction of the Charter of Patient Rights and Responsibilities which was published in September 2012. This summarises the rights and responsibilities that patients have when using NHS services.</p>
      <p>Secondary legislation to support the implementation of the Patient Rights Act came into force on 1 April 2012 and revised <a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2012_08.pdf">'Can I help you?' Good Practice Guidance</a> on handling and learning from feedback and complaints was issued to the NHS in March 2012. This makes NHS Boards directly responsible for the collection, monitoring and reporting of complaints received in relation to services they provide and places additional responsibility on Boards for the collection and monitoring of complaints received by their Family Health service providers. The emphasis is on early and local resolution and ensuring learning is shared and improvements acted upon as soon as possible after the issue that gave rise to the complaint.</p>
      <p>Responsibility for delivering healthcare to prisoners transferred from the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to NHS Scotland in November 2011.  The NHS Boards that report on prison complaints are Ayrshire &amp; Arran, Dumfries &amp; Galloway, Forth Valley, Grampian, Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde, Highland, Lanarkshire, Lothian and Tayside.</p>
      <p>The aim of the transfer was to ensure that prisoners received the same standard of care and range of services as offered to the general population according to need.  In taking over responsibility for prisoner health care, it was planned that complaints from prisoners about their health care would be dealt with in line with existing NHS complaints procedures.</p>
      
      <h3>Scottish Public Services Ombudsman</h3>
      <p>If a complainant remains dissatisfied with the response from the normal complaint process, there is recourse to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman who provides a 'one-stop-shop' for individuals making complaints about organisations providing public services in Scotland (<a href="http://www.spso.org.uk/">www.spso.org.uk</a>).</p>
      <h3>Patient Advice and Support Service (PASS)</h3>
      <p>Citizens Advice Bureaux across Scotland were funded by local NHS Boards to deliver the Independent Advice and Support Service (IASS).   The aim was to support patients, their carers and relatives in their dealings with the NHS and in other matters affecting their health. The Patient Rights (Scotland) Act 2011 made provision for the establishment of the <a href="http://www.cas.org.uk/patientadvice">Patient Advice and Support Service (PASS)</a> from 1 April 2012, and which now replaces IASS.</p>
