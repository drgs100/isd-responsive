      <h3>About these Statistics</h3> 
      <p>These data are presented for Hospital &amp; Community Health Services (HCHS) and Family Health Services (FHS) by NHS Board (e.g. NHS Fife), and for Special NHS Boards and National &amp; Support Organisations (e.g. Scottish Ambulance Service).</p>
      <p>NHS Boards including the National Waiting Times Centre and the State Hospital for Scotland submit their summary information about complaints they receive to ISD Scotland after the end of each quarter of the financial year. These data are validated by ISD and checked with individual boards after submission.</p> 
      <p>For Family Health Services, the complaints summary information is submitted manually to ISD Scotland via an annual aggregated return completed by the FHS contractors on behalf of the NHS Board.  Five broad service/contractor types are included within the Family Health Services complaints: Medical, Dental, Pharmaceutical, Ophthalmic and Administration.  These data are confirmed with the NHS Boards after submission.</p>
      <p>It was decided that in 2006/07, all Special Boards, a number of National &amp; Support Organisations would submit their complaints data to ISD at the end of each financial year.  This complaints summary information is also submitted manually to ISD Scotland via an annual aggregated return and these data confirmed with NHS organisations after submission.</p>

      <h3>Data Quality</h3> 
      <p>Until recently, in NHS organisations across Scotland, there was a lack of consistency in the application of codes to record complaints made against an NHS service. Each Complaints Office follows general guidance about complaint recording within the NHS, but may also use their own local set of categories to register the details, or have their own interpretation of how to complete the dataset.</p> <p>To help address these issues, ISD built an NHS Complaints system containing revised codes and detailed definitions and subsequently rolled out these definitions and codes nationally to ensure consistency in recording practices within NHS Boards across NHS Scotland. Implementation of this new dataset for Hospital &amp; Community Services commenced mid-way through 2008. Prior to the 2008/9 report, new codes were mapped to ensure consistency in reporting and, despite some data submission difficulties, data were received and reported against as normal.</p>
