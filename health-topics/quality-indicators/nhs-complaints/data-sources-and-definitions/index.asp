      <p id="Data-sources" class="lead">Data Sources</p>
      <p>NHS Boards and other NHS organisations deal with the complaints received by their area. Summary information for all the complaints received is recorded by each organisation and submitted to ISD.  These data are confirmed with NHS Boards/NHS organisations after submission.</p>
      <p>For Hospital &amp; Community Services, information such as the date the complaint was received, service area, issues raised, staff group and outcome of the complaint is summarised by using standard coding convention.</p>
      <p>This summary information is submitted electronically onto the ISD Complaints National Database (Universe) where it is validated and analysed.  Note that ISD does not hold any identifiable information with regards to the complaint - only summary codes for each complaint are held. The codes used are available from this link: <a href="/Health-Topics/Quality-Indicators/Publications/2015-04-28/Definitions_Document_V27_6.pdf">NHS Complaints Definitions Document</a></p>
      <p>For Family Health Services and Special NHS Boards and National &amp; Support Organisations, complaints summary information is submitted manually to ISD Scotland via an annual aggregated return by the NHS Organisation. These data are confirmed with NHS Boards/NHS organisations after submission.</p>
      <p>NHS Complaint Statistics are then published annually on the ISD website. For further information on the NHS datasets, please refer to the <a href="http://www.ndc.scot.nhs.uk/National-Datasets/Full-A-Z/index.asp" target="_blank">National Data Catalogue</a> web pages.</p>    
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
    
      <p id="Definition" class="lead">Definition of 'complaint'</p>
      <p>In the NHS complaints procedure a complaint is defined:</p>
      <blockquote>"A complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction requiring a response."</blockquote>
      <p>Citizen's Charter Complaints Task Force.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>

      <p id="actions-taken" class="lead">Actions Taken</p>
      <p>There is a requirement for NHS Boards/Organisations to demonstrate that learning at the local level as a direct result of feedback, comments, concerns and complaints has led to opportunities for improvement and action.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
    
      <p id="calculation" class="lead">Calculation of times</p>
      <p>The time taken to acknowledge a complaint is calculated using the date of receipt of complaint. The time taken to respond to a complaint is calculated using the date of receipt of complaint or where there is consent required the date consent is received at, and the date of despatch from, the Division or NHS Board. This excludes any delivery time between the complainant and the Division/NHS Board.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
    
      <p id="received" class="lead">Complaints 'received' / complaints 'dealt with'</p>
      <p>Information is reported on all complaints received within financial years, from 1996/97 onwards. In a small number of cases it is not possible to report on the response times or an outcome of complaints as the response is not known. Such complaints are classified as &quot;response not known&quot;.</p>
      <p>Please note that historic information may change slightly as the data will have been updated to allow for further reporting on these complaints in subsequent years.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
    
      <p id="issues" class="lead">Issues raised</p>
      <p>For any one complaint a maximum of three different types of issue may be recorded for national returns and for this reason the total number of issues recorded may be greater than the total number of complaints.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
        

      <p id="median-time" class="lead">Median time taken to respond</p>
      <p>The median is a useful statistic for comparing response times between organisations. The median number of days taken to respond to a complaint is such that half of all complaints received were responded to in less than this time, and half were responded to in more than this time. Note that the median is used in preference to the mean (average) to ensure that complaints that took a long time to resolve do not skew the overall picture, which could present a misleading view of how long it takes to deal with complaints on the whole.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
    

      <p id="outcomes" class="lead">Outcomes</p>
      <p>When each complaint is closed/resolved, the final outcome decision of the investigation into the complaint is accredited e.g.complaint upheld, complaint not upheld etc.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
    

      <p id="outside" class="lead">Outside agencies</p>
      <p>Details of investigations instigated by outside agencies (e.g. Police, Health Service Commissioner, Coroner's Court) are not included in the national returns.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
    

      <p id="private" class="lead">Private sector</p>
      <p>In cases where the complainant has complained directly to a private sector organisation that is providing NHS care, information about the complaint may not necessarily be reported.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
    

      <p id="service-area" class="lead">Service Area</p>
      <p>For each complaint an associated service group is attributed e.g. hospital acute services, prison services etc.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>    
    

      <p id="staff" class="lead">Staff group</p>
      <p>For each complaint an associated staff group is attributed. This does not imply, however, that a particular member of staff in that group was directly involved in the circumstances leading to the complaint. For example, a complaint against a hospital for its lack of car parking facilities would be coded under &quot;Division administrative staff/members&quot;.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
    

      <p id="acknowledge" class="lead">Time taken to acknowledge</p>
      <p>The time taken to acknowledge a complaint is calculated using working days. Analysis for 2005/06 onwards has been updated to exclude public holidays, however analysis prior to 2005/06 does not take into account any local or national public holidays. Any investigation of a complaint completed within five days of receipt is notionally treated as if it had been acknowledged within three days, irrespective of whether a formal acknowledgement was actually made in that time.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
    

      <p id="time" class="lead">Time taken to respond</p>
      <p>The time taken to respond is calculated over 20 working days (20 working days is the equivalent of 28 calendar days). It should be noted that for analysis prior to 2005/06 public holidays are not taken into account when response times are calculated. Analysis for 2005/06 onwards has been updated to take account of public holidays.</p>
