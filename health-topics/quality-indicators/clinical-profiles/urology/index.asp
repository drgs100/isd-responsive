      <p><em>Includes data for January 2014 - December 2014.</em></p>
      <p>The Urology dashboard is password protected and accessible only to appropriate clinical staff. The system provides access to clinical outcome indicators on a number of <a href="Data/20140205_Urology_operational_definitions.pdf">urology conditions and interventions</a>. The data provide hospital comparisons against Scotland for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014 and five-year trends between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014.</p>
      <p>The outcomes focus on mortality, emergency readmissions and length of stay.  A <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Quality-Indicators/Profiles/Urology/Data/Urology-Indicators.pdf">detailed description of how these measures are derived</a> is available.</p>
      <p>The one-year funnel plot distributions of mortality and readmission are  based on rates standardised against Scotland for age, sex and  deprivation. The time-series measures are not standardised to take  account of demographic factors or case-mix.</p>
      
      <h3>Data Sources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR01) hospital discharge summary</li>
        <li>National Records of Scotland (NRS) death registrations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>ISD Scotland routinely links these independent sources of data at a patient level to form &lsquo;patient record sets&rsquo;. Within these 'patient record sets', the SMR01 records are grouped into continuous stays. A continuous stay is a continuous period of time spent as an inpatient or day case in hospital regardless of any transfers between specialties or hospitals. For example, a patient may be admitted to General Surgery, be transferred to Urology and then transferred again to Geriatric Assessment before discharge. This single continuous stay would have generated three separate SMR01 discharge records but linkage has retrospectively brought them together.</p>
