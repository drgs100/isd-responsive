      <h2>Clinical Profiles</h2>
      <p>The aim of Clinical Profiles (formerly  Surgical and Medical Profiles) is to stimulate reflective clinical practice and  facilitate improvements in the care of patients, by making good use of existing  Scotland-wide datasets.</p>
      <p>Organisations/teams that provide  clinical care cannot always guarantee good clinical outcomes for their  patients. However, they should know what these outcomes are, and also use such  information to reflect on - and guide improvements to the services they provide  for their populations.</p>
      <p>Clinical Profiles comprise a portfolio  of collaborative projects led by Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) and the  Information Services Division (ISD) and are being developed in close  collaboration with a number of clinical specialty groups in Scotland, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the Royal  College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow are also linked in to the  project. </p>
      <p>Clinical Profiles aim to support the  Healthcare Quality Strategy for NHS Scotland, which itself emphasises the  critically important role of data/measurement in driving improvements in  patient care. </p>
      
      <h3>A New Approach</h3>
      <p>The previous methodology involved the  biennial production of either a medical or surgical profile (alternate years)  containing a series of clinical indicators arranged according to specialty  chapters. A key aspect of the work was the formal and structured dialogue with  each NHS Board about how it was interpreting and using the data locally. There  are examples of the profiles being used successfully to stimulate improvements  in clinical care, data, and governance systems. The project's methodology,  which was established in 2006, is being refreshed to ensure that it can  continue to help make things better for patients while providing good value for  public money. The National Clinical Data Advisory Group recommended that,  instead of producing a fourth version of the surgical profile in March 2013  using the existing format, the project team should focus on more in-depth and  continuous work with clinicians and specialty groups to develop indicators that  are credible, timely and fit-for-purpose. Work in line with this new approach  has already begun and is described below.</p>
      
      <h3>Current  Projects</h3>
      <p>The operational definitions  of all the indicators within each project described below have been developed  in consultation with clinical specialty groups or expert clinical advisors for  a particular disease or procedure and are typically categorised according to length  of stay, mortality and readmissions.</p>
			<p>The clinical profile makes use of existing national data sources in a format  designed to make it easier for NHS Boards to use the information. The main data  source is the Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR01) linked to National Records of  Scotland (NRS) Death registrations.</p>
      <p>Most of the clinical  indicators in clinical profiles are presented in graphs called control charts.  A control chart is a simple way of presenting data that can help guide quality  improvement activities, by flagging up areas where there appears to be marked  variation and where further local investigation might be beneficial. 
      <p>There are two types of  control chart in the profile:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Funnel plots, which allow comparisons to be  made between different NHS Boards or hospitals and the average for Scotland. Data are plotted in  relation to the Scottish average and control limits set at three standard  deviations from the average. Data points out with the control limits (sometimes  called &lsquo;outliers&rsquo;) are said to exhibit &lsquo;special cause variation&rsquo;. This is where  further investigation might be beneficial. However, it is important not just to focus on &lsquo;outliers&rsquo;,  and with local knowledge subtler patterns in the data can also help gain an  understanding of how clinical services are provided.</li>
        <li>Time series, which allows a service provider  to monitor and review quarterly observations over a ten-year period in  comparison to the equivalent Scotland  trajectory.</li>
      </ul>     
			<p>The team has developed new presentation  methods for the clinical profiles using the latest dashboard technology.  This has enabled frontline staff to interrogate patterns in their own activity  and outcomes, as recorded on the national datasets, with a reporting lag of as  little as four months.      </p>
	    <p>Clinical profiles have been  designed as management information systems to be interpreted and used locally  by NHS boards and clinicians. They present a range of data about medical and  surgical activity and outcomes in Scotland. The data are most  commonly presented by hospital of treatment; however, increasingly we will also  be showing distributions of the same outcomes according to the resident  populations of each NHS board. As  before, the NHS boards will be responsible for reviewing, and where necessary  acting upon, their own data. Local and expert knowledge needs to be drawn upon  to meaningfully interpret the data and the clinical profile should complement  other sources of local intelligence. It is important to note that the data in  the clinical profile cannot be used alone as a basis for making reliable  judgements about the quality of clinical care.</p>
	  
      <h3>Previous Projects</h3>
	    <p>Healthcare Improvement Scotland is currently evolving aspects of what was previously the surgical and medical profiles methodology, to seek to enhance clinical engagement and maximise the influence that indicators derived from routine administrative datasets have in driving improvements in patient care. Information about the previous profiles projects (2006-2012) can be accessed below via links to the original surgical and medical profiles websites. Although the data/information included are now historical and there are currently no plans to refresh all the analyses, this information is still presented to allow access to the work/data at a point in time.</p>
