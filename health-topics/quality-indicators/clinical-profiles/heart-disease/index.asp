      <h2>Heart Disease</h2>
			
      <p>In September 2011, Healthcare  Improvement Scotland published the Heart Disease Improvement Programme National  Overview - <a href="http://www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org/our_work/cardiovascular_disease/heart_disease_services/heart_disease_service_review.aspx">Take  Heart</a>. The aim was to make sure  people with heart disease in Scotland  have person-centred, safe and effective care. A key element of the Programme is  to work with Information Services Division (ISD) on development of a system of  measurement and performance assessment for heart disease services using a suite  of heart disease indicators.</p>
      <p>A potential suite of 14 high-level  indicators sourced from the routinely linked national hospital and deaths database  maintained by ISD was drawn up. The medical and surgical profiles team at ISD  had already produced a chapter on Coronary Heart Disease (2010 data) as part of  the first Medical Profile which was released to boards in March 2012, and there  were considerable overlaps with the suite of indicators being proposed. In  February 2013, the new look Clinical Profiles collaboration undertook to  reconcile the definitions against those of the medical profile and consolidate  the process by producing a national report for all boards in Scotland  accompanied by an appropriate management information system.</p>
      <p>A small short life working group  encompassing a number of specialists in Cardiology was formed to advise the  collaboration on definitions and interpretation of emerging analyses during the  developmental phase. Initial findings were presented to and were endorsed by  the Scottish Government's National Advisory Committee on Heart Disease on 28  May 2013. </p>
      <p>The final report was released to  boards as management information in July 2013. The  accompanying management information system is being made available for the  first time here.</p>

      <p>The Heart Disease dashboard is password protected and  accessible only to appropriate clinical staff. The system provides access to clinical outcome indicators on a  number of heart disease conditions and interventions, <a href="/Health-Topics/Quality-Indicators/Profiles/Heart-Disease/Data/Heart-Disease-Operational-definitions_appendix-1.pdf">for operational definitions</a>. The data provide hospital and health  board of residence comparisons against Scotland for the period 1 October  2011 to 30 September 2012 and ten-year trends between 1 October 2002 and 30  September 2012. </p>
      <p>The outcomes focus on mortality, emergency readmissions and length of stay.  A <a href="/Health-Topics/Quality-Indicators/Profiles/Heart-Disease/Data/Heart-Disease-Indicators.pdf">detailed description of how these measures are derived is available</a>.  </p>
      <p>The one-year funnel plot distributions of mortality and readmission are  based on rates standardised against Scotland for age, sex and  deprivation. The time-series measures have not been standardised to take  account of demographic factors or case-mix.</p>
      
      <h3>Data Sources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR01) hospital discharge summary</li>
        <li>National Records of Scotland (NRS) death registrations </li>
      </ul>
      <p>ISD Scotland routinely links these independent sources of data at a patient  level to form &lsquo;patient record sets&rsquo;. Within these 'patient record sets', the  SMR01 records are grouped into continuous stays. A continuous stay is a  continuous period of time spent as an inpatient or day case in hospital  regardless of any transfers between specialties or hospitals. For example, a  patient may be admitted with an acute MI in a specialty of General Medicine, be  transferred to Cardiology then transferred again to Geriatric Assessment before  discharge. This single continuous stay would have generated three separate  SMR01 discharge records but linkage has retrospectively brought them together.</p>
