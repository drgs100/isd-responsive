      <h2>Developments</h2>
        
     	<p>The developments for the Quality Indicators service  area arise mainly from the <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/Policy/Quality-Strategy">Quality Strategy</a>:</p>
     	
      <h3>Quality Measurement Framework</h3>
     	<p>During 2012/13 we will be reporting on the Quality Measurement Framework (a  series of 12  national indicators focusing on  improvement activity, performance management and tracking progress on  outcomes).</p>

     	<h3>Quality Hub</h3>
     	<p>The Quality Hub is a combination of human and  software resources to support quality improvement activity throughout NHSS. The  three organisations that form the Quality Alliance each has a responsibility  for one of the  three components: the provision of learning resources led  by NHS Education Scotland (NES), a communications and coordination role led by  Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) and the key role of our service area within  ISD is to provide support for measurement activity.</p>
     	<p>For more information see the <a href="http://www.qihub.scot.nhs.uk/home.aspx">Quality Improvement Hub</a> website.</p>

     	<h3>Profiles</h3>
     	<p>We recognise that there is a paucity of audit data  on the management of patients with medical conditions so we have produced, in  conjunction with our colleagues in Health Improvement Scotland, a Medical  Profile that is similar in design and function to the Surgical Profile. For  more information see <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Quality-Indicators/Profiles/">Profiles</a>. </p>
     	
      <h3>Quality Improvement  National Reporting Tool</h3>
     	<p>Information Services Division (ISD) as part of the HUB collaboration is  tasked with developing and maintaining a national reporting tool that will  support the measurement and monitoring of progress of a range of Quality  Improvement Indicators and Outcomes. The reporting tool will be an integral  part of the HUB and will initially provide support to the Scottish Patient  Safety Programme and the Leading Better Care - Clinical Quality Indicators  Programme. The system will replace some of the functionality currently  available within the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Extranet but the  key functions will be to extract data electronically direct from local Health  Board Quality Improvement Systems and to provide Health Boards and other key  stakeholders with a series of predefined standard reports.</p>
