      <h2>Hospital Scorecard</h2>

      <p>The purpose of the Hospital Scorecard will be to permit assessment, <strong>at  hospital level only</strong>, of indicators covering a range of domains such as patient safety, inpatient  activity, infection control and patient experience. It will be used to flag up at an early stage any  possible problems with delivering high quality healthcare in a hospital, and  will be part of the toolkit for monitoring quality and implementing a cycle of  ongoing service improvement at local level.</p>        
      <p>The Hospital Scorecard consists of the following indicators:</p>      
      <ul>
        <li>Hospital  Standardised Mortality Rates (HSMR)</li>
        <li>Medical  Readmissions</li>
        <li>Surgical  Readmissions</li>
        <li>Medical  Length of Stay</li>
        <li>Surgical  Length of Stay</li>
        <li>A &amp;  E Waiting Times</li>
        <li>C-Difficile  Infection Rates</li>
        <li>SAB  Infection Rates</li>
        <li>Patient  Experience Survey</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Scorecard is produced on a quarterly basis and allows comparison of  each hospital&rsquo;s performance for each of the above indicators against the  national average and identifies outliers that may warrant further investigation  or scrutiny.</p>
