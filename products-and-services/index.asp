    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>ISD has been an authoritative source of Scottish national healthcare statistics for over 50 years. As an experienced healthcare, and more recently social care, partner; ISD is uniquely positioned to provide support in information design, development and application to enhance decisions about healthcare and ultimately improve Scotland's health. We offer a wide range of high quality, high value consultancy services and products tailored specifically to Scottish health needs. These range from provision of interpretation, advice, training and support on new and existing data collections and their application, through to direct access for authorised information analysts and researchers to our key national datasets</p>
    
    <p>Researchers may also be interested in our cancer clinical trials service or may wish to extend the boundaries of their own data sets (e.g. for follow-up studies) through links with our national data sets. We also maintain a wide range of information tools in areas such as performance monitoring and risk prediction used extensively by NHSScotland to enhance service provision. Our Information Request teams are on hand to advise if you can't find the answers to your questions through our routine publications. See below for further details or contact the Customer Services helpdesk if you are unsure which service you require.</p>
